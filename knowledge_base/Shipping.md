#🚚 Shipping Policy — Product Assistant AI

Last updated: October 2025

At Product Assistant AI, we aim to provide a seamless shopping experience — from product discovery to simulated delivery. The details below describe how shipping and order tracking are handled within our system.

##1. Shipping Coverage

Shipments are simulated and available for all regions listed in your account preferences.

Physical delivery is not performed as part of this prototype; however, all simulated processes follow standard e-commerce practices.

Users can select between Standard or Express simulated shipping.

##2. Processing Time

Orders are processed within 1–2 business days after confirmation.

Once processed, a simulated tracking number is generated and shared with the user.

You can ask the AI Assistant:

“Where is my order?” or “Track my shipment”
to receive live tracking updates from the simulation.

##3. Estimated Delivery Time
Shipping Method	Estimated Delivery Time
Standard Shipping	5–7 business days
Express Shipping	2–3 business days

(All delivery times are estimates for simulation purposes and may vary.)

##4. Order Tracking

After an order is “shipped,” you will receive a tracking link or tracking ID.

You can query the AI Assistant at any time to check your shipment’s simulated location and estimated delivery date.

##5. Lost or Delayed Shipments

If your simulated order shows no movement for more than 7 business days, contact the AI Support Assistant.

The AI will investigate the simulated logistics issue and issue a replacement or refund if necessary.

##6. Shipping Restrictions

Some simulated items may have restrictions based on:

Product category (e.g., batteries, large appliances).

Destination region.

Carrier limitations within the simulation.

##7. Contact

For questions about shipping or tracking, please contact the Product Assistant AI Support through chat or simulated email:
