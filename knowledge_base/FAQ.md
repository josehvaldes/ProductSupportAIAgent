Welcome to the Product Assistant AI FAQ section. Here you’ll find answers to the most common questions about simulated orders, shipping, returns, and warranties.

##🛍️ Orders & Payments

###1. How do I place an order?
Simply ask the AI Assistant to find a product and confirm your selection. Once confirmed, the system simulates checkout and generates an order ID for reference.

You can say:

“Track my order” or “Where is my shipment?”
The AI will provide real-time simulated tracking updates.

###3. Can I cancel an order after placing it?
Yes. Orders can be canceled within 24 hours of placement, unless they have already entered the simulated shipping stage.

###4. What payment methods are accepted?
Since this is a prototype, all payments are simulated. In a real implementation, common options would include credit/debit cards, PayPal, or store credit.

##🚚 Shipping

###5. How long does shipping take?

Standard Shipping: 5–7 business days

Express Shipping: 2–3 business days
All shipping times are simulated and may vary depending on product type.

If your simulated order hasn’t arrived within the estimated time, the AI will investigate and offer a replacement or refund as needed.
