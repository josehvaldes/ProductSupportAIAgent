#🛠️ Warranty Policy — Product Assistant AI

Last updated: October 2025

At Product Assistant AI, we want users to feel confident in every simulated purchase. The following policy outlines how warranties are represented and handled within the product assistant experience.

##1. Warranty Overview

Every product listed within the simulation includes a standard 1-year limited warranty, unless otherwise stated in the product details.

Some simulated brands may offer extended warranties or protection plans that can be added at checkout.

Warranties cover manufacturing defects and malfunctioning hardware within the coverage period.

##2. What the Warranty Covers

Defects in materials or workmanship under normal use.

Malfunctioning screens, buttons, batteries, or charging ports.

Simulated replacements or repairs for eligible items.

##3. What the Warranty Does Not Cover

Damage caused by misuse, accidents, or unauthorized modifications.

Normal wear and tear, cosmetic damage, or scratches.

Lost or stolen products.

Software issues not related to hardware malfunction.

##4. Warranty Claims Process

Contact the Product Assistant AI Support via chat or simulated email.

Provide your order ID, product name, and a description of the issue.

The AI will verify warranty eligibility and provide next steps.

If approved, you’ll receive instructions for simulated repair or replacement within 3–5 business days.

##5. Extended Warranty Options

Select items may include optional protection plans that extend coverage beyond 1 year.

These plans can be activated during checkout or within 30 days of purchase.

Ask the AI:

“Does this TV have an extended warranty?”
or
“What does the protection plan include?”

##6. Manufacturer Warranties

Some simulated products include manufacturer-backed warranties. In such cases:

The AI Assistant will direct you to the brand’s warranty service page.

The manufacturer will handle all warranty-related actions.
